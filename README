SVG2ASS - SVG To ASS Converter
==============================

OVERVIEW

SVG2ASS feeds on SVG files and drops ASS dialog lines, ready for 
pasting in e.g. Aegisub. Only a basic set of SVG funtionality is 
supported, whereas most of the more advanced features are simply 
ignored. You can work around some of these limitations by converting 
all objects to paths and flattening your SVG as much as feasible.
The SVG is not validated at all, thus you might get away with 
converting some Shakespeare play and get some fancy shapes from it.

Supported elements:
  * line
  * rect (square and rounded corners)
  * circle, ellipse
  * path (except elliptical arcs!)

Supported attributes:
  * attributes essential to the elements listed above
  * selected styles: colors/alpha for fill and stroke; stroke width
  * transform (translate, scale, rotate, skewX, skewY, matrix)

The generated ASS dialog lines follow this format description:
Dialogue: Layer,Start,End,Style,Name,MarginL,MarginR,MarginV,Effect,Text


BUILD IT

SVG2ASS should easily build on an average GNU/Linux or other POSIX 
compliant system by just executing make.  On other systems just slab 
it together using compiler and linker, see Makefile - nothing fancy 
there. However, depending on your runtime environment, you might 
have provide your own getopt, strdup or strcasecmp implementations. 
Also, you might have to manually copy version.in to version.h


RUN IT

Execute svg2ass -h to obtain a short help text about program usage.
Among other general and ASS related fairly self explaining command 
line options, SVG2ASS provides an option to render all shapes into a 
single drawing command per SVG file (which forces all shapes to use 
teh same initial color and border width settings), or, alternatively,
produce a seperate dialog line for each shape (which is the default). 


LEGALESE
