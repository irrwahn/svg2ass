SVG2ASS - World's Lousiest SVG To ASS Converter


SVG MY ASS?!?

SVG2ASS feeds on SVG files and drops ASS dialog lines, ready for 
pasting in e.g. Aegisub. Only a basic set of SVG funtionality is 
supported, whereas most of the more advanced features are simply 
ignored. You can work around some of these limitations by converting 
all objects to paths and flattening your SVG as much as feasible.
The SVG is not validated at all, thus you might get away with 
converting some Shakespeare play and get some fancy shapes from it.

Supported elements:
  * line
  * rect
  * circle, ellipse
  * path (except elliptical arcs!)

Supported attributes:
  * attributes essential to the elements listed above
  * styles: colors/alpha for fill and stroke; stroke width
  * transformations (translate, scale, rotate, skewX, skewY, matrix)


BUILD IT

Just slab it together using compiler and linker, see Makefile. Nothing 
fancy there, save that one peculiarity: define _POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L 
to make for happy getopt and strdup. If your environment lacks standard 
UNIX tools (sh, tempfile, grep, head, ...) you have to manually provide 
a version.h containing something similar to this:
  #define VERSION "0.1.0"
  #define SVNVER "289"


RUN IT

Execute svg2ass -h to obtain a short help text about program usage.
Among other general and ASS related, fairly self explaining command 
line options, SVG2ASS provides an option to render all shapes into a 
single drawing command per SVG file (which makes all shapes use the 
same initial color and border width settings), or to produce a 
seperate dialog line for each shape (which is the default).
