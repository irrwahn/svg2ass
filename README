Welcome to ... *drumroll* ... SVG2ASS!
(A.k.a world's lousiest SVG to ASS converter)


HUH, SVG MY ASS?!?

SVG2ASS feeds on SVG files and drops ASS snippets, ready to make your 
eyes bleed when pasted in e.g. Aegisub. Only a selection of actually 
useful basic SVG features is supported, whereas most of the more 
"advanced" (read: crammed in) SVG crap is simply ignored. You can work 
around some of the limitations by converting everything (even the 
kitchen sink) to paths and flattening your SVG as much as feasible.
The SVG is not validated at all, thus you might get away with feeding 
SVG2ASS some Shakespeare play and get some fancy shapes from it.

Supported elements:
* line (Yay!)
* rect (WooOOOoot!)
* circle, ellipse (despite ASS having no ellipse primitive; 
    now go read the code and cower in fear!)
* path (except arcs - which is indeed a severe shortcoming, even more 
    so, as e.g. Inkscape uses arc paths instead of "real" ellipses. 
    WTF? )

Supported attributes:
* essential attributes WRT the elements listed above
* styles: colors/alpha for fill and stroke; stroke width
* transform: not (yet)

That's pretty much it. Not half bad, you think? Well, here's the catch:
 
Advanced SubStation Alpha drawing command syntax is a fine example of 
how to miss a fly with a bowling ball at point-blank range. One result 
of this madness is (now buckle your belt, Dorothy, 'cause Kansas is 
going bye-bye) that you can choose, if you'd rather have  
  a) your shape coordinates (layout) messed up, or 
  b) only the last color definiton applied to all the shapes in a line. 
Future versions of SVG2ASS may provide a command line switch to let 
you choose your favorite variety of fuck-up. 

(On a side note: I'm not sure, if real-world SVG does that much better. 
It's XML after all, what can you expect? MFW when I realised I'd need 
three(!) parsers to support even the most basic features. D'uh!)


BUILD IT!

Just slab it together using compiler and linker, see Makefile. Nothing 
fancy there, save that one peculiarity: want _POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L 
define, or else the string stuff will go awry. (I wonder if I should 
subtitute sxmlc with something even dumber and thus avoid the define.  
Would better fit the spirit of the project as well.)
