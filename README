SVG2ASS - World's Lousiest SVG To ASS Converter


SVG MY ASS?!?

SVG2ASS feeds on SVG files and drops ASS snippets, ready to make your 
eyes bleed when pasted in e.g. Aegisub. Only a selection of actually 
useful basic SVG features is supported, whereas most of the more 
"advanced" (read: crammed in) SVG crap is simply ignored. You can work 
around some of the limitations by converting everything (even the 
kitchen sink) to paths and flattening your SVG as much as feasible.
The SVG is not validated at all, thus you might get away with feeding 
SVG2ASS some Shakespeare play and get some fancy shapes from it.

Supported elements:
  * line
  * rect
  * circle, ellipse
  * path (except elliptical arcs!)

Supported attributes:
  * attributes essential to the elements listed above
  * styles: colors/alpha for fill and stroke; stroke width
  * transformations (translate, scale, rotate, skewX, skewY, matrix)

That's pretty much it, and here's a catch:
 
Advanced SubStation Alpha drawing command syntax is a fine example of 
how to miss a fly with a bowling ball at point-blank range. One result 
of this madness is that you can choose between having
  a) your shape coordinates (layout) messed up, or 
  b) only the last color definiton applied to all the shapes in a line. 
SVG2ASS provides a command line switch to let you choose your favorite 
variety of fuck-up. To get both working correctly you'd have to go 
with a) and spread the drawing sequences over separate lines.


BUILD IT!

Just slab it together using compiler and linker, see Makefile. Nothing 
fancy there, save that one peculiarity: define _POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L 
to make for happy getopt and strdup.
